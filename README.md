View : will be wrapped with provider which helps to connect from react with redux

Folder Creation:üóÇ
    ReduxüìÇ: can be named any
        Files:‚ñ§
            - action.js
            - reducer.js
            - rootReducer.js - to make connection or combine 
            - store.js
            - saga will also be created if you use it
    
        Now Wrap with Redux Provider in index.js(main file)
            - creating provider
                - Provider comes with attributes of store , i.e : store={props}, without this your app will break
                - ? what is store - Store is a place where all your data is kept 
                - so now work in store file - to create store
                - once you pass as a props store to index.js, to connect your store should link with reducer


Interview Questions: 
1. What is the use of provider ?
    => It is imported from react-redux, it's work is to connect react with redux

2. What is store ?
    => The connection that we are making with react-redux , store keeps all the data of application. 

3. What is the input and output of Store ?
    => Input of store is : `` Reducer ``  : output of Store is :`` createStore function which helps to inject data into our application ``
##### ‚ò£Ô∏è in next branch we will create - action & reducer 


----------------------------------------

### ‚úÖ ‚òÄÔ∏è day 2:

Actions:
In this session we'll learn how actions are created, called, thumbrules of redux
    1. What is action is redux ?
        => 1.1. Actions are the plain functions
                -> Normal js functions similar , it is used to send data from reactjs to redux
            1.2.  Get Data from Reactjs
                -> anything we want to call from reactjs we call actions
            1.3. Send Data to Reducer after Process
                -> Any time we get data from reactjs we need to send it to reducer through actions
                 Reducer stores that data
                 ? Why can't we put data into reducer -> inside reducer we keep raw data, in which we have to directly store inside store, so inside reducer we cannot process data, every logic is done using 'action' , and reducer doesnot have that capability to directly store, so actions have that capabilities, because it is designed in that architecture
            1.4. Must have type key in return statement
                -> ThumbRule: whenever we return anything inside actions it must have a type key, sothat each other can connect to share data
            1.5. Much Sync type with reducer
                -> the same type key should be provided to reducer also to connect

    2. Make Action function ?
        -> Add to cart functionality - one component to another

    3. Call action function
        -> see diagram architecture in part 1 to understand workflow
            -> create action-> reducer -> store
            3.1 -> do not import directly , use dispatch method to import in redux way -> App.js
                -> Dispatch : sending | dispatching data from action.js
                once type is defined send data and your action is called now 
                but, where the data is going ?
                    ->

    4. Interview Question
        4.1. What is Action & how to use/call ?
            -> call is done through useDispatch hook, which is provided by react-redux, action work is to  get data from react and send to reducer
        4.2. How action know where to send data ?
            -> it is known with the help of key 'type' 

---------------------------------------------

### ‚úÖ ‚òÄÔ∏è day 3: Reducer
Topics Covered: 
    1. What is reducer

        1.1. Reducer handle data for store i.e how data will pass from react to store this is decided by reducer
        
        1.2. Update Data in store
        1.3. Rules:
            1.3.1. Need Root Reducer
            1.3.2. Reducer must return the some value
            1.3.3. The reducer must have some initial value


            Workflow: 

        Action -------> Reducer ---rootReducer-----> Store ----
           /\                                                   |
           |                                                    |
           |        Redux Architecture                          |
           |                                                    |
           |                                                    |
            ----------- View <----------------------------------

    2. Make Reducer
    3. Make RootReducer
    4. Test data flow
    5. Interview Questions
        5.1 - Do data persists when we refres page ? - No that is why we initialize some default value in reducer
    

- Explain : 
-   - When we called action by clicking addToCart button how reducer knew what action to call i.e i mean to say there could be many action instead of single action i.e addToCart there'd have : removeFromCart, UpdateCart, DeleteCart etc. so to maintain this we use help of type : remember we declared in action , generally we do it by using switch case statement , but lets first do it by if else then we will learn with switch case - more in reducer.js


- - we use constant.js - to keep everything in same place in case we made some mistake we dont need to look through every page where ever we've used so every type of action is kept inside constant.js

---------------------------------------
### day -4 ‚úÖ üéõ switch case for reducer

###### Switch Statement in reducer

-   Why need Switch statement inside Reducer

        1. Because, our system can have many action to perform and if else is good for 2-3 cases but if when it starts getting larger it is not taken as a good practicner. - reducer

-   Make Switch Statement
-   Check Some with Switch Statement

--------------------------------

### day -5 ü§î ‚úÖ ‚ñ§ get data from redux to component

-   Topics covered :
    - Make header and main component
        1. Create component üìÇ
        2. create file - üóÉ
    - Add images and css
    - Send Data from main component
    - Get Data in Header component
    - Interview Question

        1. How can you get data from redux to react ? -> using useSelector hook
        2. where you can make use of useSelector hook ? while fetching data from redux to react

-------------------------------

### day -6 Remove cart ‚ùå and empty cart üì≠

-   Topics üõê covered :
    - Make more action and reducers
        - action & reducer for both action and reducers

    - Make remove from the cart and empty cart Button
        - to call those action & reducer we make a button

    - Actions and Reducers for both
        - 
    - Update Cart Count in Data in Header Component
    - Interview Question
        - In this example we haven't seen if arr.length less than 0 then how can we handle this ? this might can be the question => we can make conditional chaining if data.length present  call it else empty 
        - i.e  data.length = data.length ? data.length-1:[];

- We haven't started saga till now we'll be learning and exploring saga (for dynamic data manipulation)

-------------------------------

### day -7 Redux Toolkit üõ† new action reducer file ‚ñ§

-   Topics üõê Covered

-   Make Action & Reducer in New File
    - creating a new file - productAction
-   Add Redux ToolKit
    - Why need reduxToolkit ? 
        - if we remember in store.js , we've used createStore "it comes with linethrough in createStore" because it is depriciated, so in place of createStore we need to use configure store
        - and configureStore comes with reduxToolkit not with redux 
        - to use it install : npm i @reduxjs/toolkit - after install use it in store.js

-   Why we need Saga Live Example
    - any where we make api call we use saga: to handle async data
        - calling api in productAction without saga &
        - discussing about in productAction only about 

----------------------

### day -8 : Configure Saga üîØ üññ ( Middleware to handle promise )
