View : will be wrapped with provider which helps to connect from react with redux

Folder Creation:üóÇ
    ReduxüìÇ: can be named any
        Files:‚ñ§
            - action.js
            - reducer.js
            - rootReducer.js - to make connection or combine 
            - store.js
            - saga will also be created if you use it
    
        Now Wrap with Redux Provider in index.js(main file)
            - creating provider
                - Provider comes with attributes of store , i.e : store={props}, without this your app will break
                - ? what is store - Store is a place where all your data is kept 
                - so now work in store file - to create store
                - once you pass as a props store to index.js, to connect your store should link with reducer
